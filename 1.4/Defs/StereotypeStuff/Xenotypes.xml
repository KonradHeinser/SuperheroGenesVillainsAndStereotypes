        <label>mundane super</label>
        <description>In terms of combat potential, this is one of the weakest supers out there. These supers tend to work better with their mind than their fists, and about a third of them don't even have any special genes beyond their basic superhero gene.</description>

        <label>war super</label>
        <description>The generic label of "war super" was created to catch all those supers who specialized in combat, but didn't quite fit in with mancers. This label covers a wide range of supers, from pugulists and ninjas to hackers and druids.</description>

        <label>summoner super</label>
        <description>Summoners are one of the few supers who are never sent to the battlefield as their powers are much more suited to colony support. These people are capable of creating resources from what appears to be nothing by bringing resources from deep in the planet to the surface, or by infusing a plant with energy that allows them to grow even on stone.</description>
