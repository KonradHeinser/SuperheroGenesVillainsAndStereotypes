        <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was part of an experiment to create an uncontrollable super-soldier with the intention of being dropped into an enemy encampment, where [PAWN_pronoun] would fight everyone around [PAWN_objective] until they died, or killed everyone in the area.

[PAWN_nameDef] survived until the next ship arrived by eating the other experiments, and eventually had to flee the ship [PAWN_pronoun] was escaping on due to uncontrollable bloodlust.</baseDesc>
