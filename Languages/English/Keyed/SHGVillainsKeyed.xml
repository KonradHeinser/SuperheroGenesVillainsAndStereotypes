    <SHG_VillainEnd>Everything that was once living on this planet is dead, leaving it ripe for you and the other members of the League to claim.\n\nTo be honest I didn't expect anyone to wait this long, or to get to this point in general. I mean, I didn't even give you something nice to look at while you waited. Thank you for playing Rimworld with the Superhero Genes mod! Please make sure to give the mod a thumbs up in the workshop if you enjoyed it to make it more likely that others will have a chance to see the mod.\n\nIn the future I plan on giving a chance to save the world instead of only being able to destroy it with Superhero Genes - Hero Organization. Currently, I plan to make that mod include a faction that can oppose the League of Villains much like the Empire does now, and I hope some of the things that will be included in it will bring more entertainment to everyone.</SHG_VillainEnd>
