    <SHG_VillainEnd>Everything that was once living on this planet is dead, leaving it ripe for you and the other members of the League to claim.\n\nTo be honest I didn't expect anyone to wait this long, or to get to this point in general. I mean, I didn't even give you something nice to look at while you waited. Thank you for playing Rimworld with the Superhero Genes mod!</SHG_VillainEnd>

    <SHG_Villains_ModDescription>Combine enough greed with a group of superheroes, and you may find yourself with a planetary threat. Supervillain gangs create small encampments across the land to act as a base to return to when they get bored of raiding. Many of these camps band together to create one massive nigh-unstoppable Villain Gang, the League of Villains.\n\nWhile the League has no qualms taking the world for their own, they may reward those that commit villainous deeds, especially if those deeds leave leveled settlements in their wake.\n\nSecond mod of the Superhero Genes series.</SHG_Villains_ModDescription>
